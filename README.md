## Installation

First, download from the repository both packages (client and server)

Then, once they are downloaded, open the terminal on the client folder and execute:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running HostEase

```bash
# development
$ npm run dev
```

Remember to add your own application.properties file on the server folder, inside of src/main/resources/application.properties (you may need to create the resources folder)
